        <h2><b><u>Earthquake</u></b></h2>
        <p>Earthquake

            An earthquake is a phenomenon that occurs without warning and involves violent shaking of the ground and everything over it. It results from the release of accumulated stress of the moving lithospheric or crustal plates. The earth's crust is divided into seven major plates, that are about 50 miles thick, which move slowly and continuously over the earth's interior and several minor plates. Earthquakes are tectonic in origin; that is the moving plates are responsible for the occurrence of violent shakes. The occurrence of an earthquake in a populated area may cause numerous casualties and injuries as well as extensive damage to property.</p><br>
        <p>The Earthquake Risk in India

            India's increasing population and extensive unscientific constructions mushrooming all over, including multistoried luxury apartments, huge factory buildings, gigantic malls, supermarkets as well as warehouses and masonry buildings keep - India at high risk. During the last 15 years, the country has experienced 10 major earthquakes that have resulted in over 20,000 deaths. As per the current seismic zone map of the country (IS 1893: 2002), over 59 per cent of India’s land area is under threat of moderate to severe seismic hazard-; that means it is prone to shaking of MSK Intensity VII and above (BMTPC, 2006). In fact, the entire Himalayan belt is considered prone to great earthquakes of magnitude exceeding 8.0-; and in a relatively short span of about 50 years, four such earthquakes have occurred: 1897 Shillong (M8.7); 1905 Kangra (M8.0); 1934 Bihar-Nepal (M8.3); and 1950 Assam-Tibet (M8.6). Scientific publications have warned of the likelihood of the occurrence of very severe earthquakes in the Himalayan region, which could adversely affect the lives of several million people in India.</p><br>
        <p>At one time regions of the country away from the Himalayas and other inter-plate boundaries were considered to be relatively safe from damaging earthquakes. However, in the recent past, even these areas have experienced devastating earthquakes, albeit of lower magnitude than the Himalayan earthquakes. The Koyna earthquake in 1967 led to revision of the seismic zoning map, resulting in deletion of the non-seismic zone from the map. The areas surrounding Koyna were also re-designated to Seismic Zone IV, indicating high hazard. The occurrence of the Killari earthquake in 1993 resulted in further revision of the seismic zoning map in which the low hazard zone or Seismic Zone I was merged with Seismic Zone II, and some parts of Deccan and Peninsular India were brought under Seismic Zone III consisting of areas designated as moderate hazard zone areas. Recent research suggests that as understanding of the seismic hazard of these regions increases, more areas assigned as low hazard may be re-designated to higher level of seismic hazard, or vice-versa.</p><br>
        <p>The North-Eastern part of the country continues to experience moderate to large earthquakes at frequent intervals including the two great earthquakes mentioned above. Since 1950, the region has experienced several moderate earthquakes. On an average, the region experiences an earthquake with a magnitude greater than 6.0 every year. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are also situated on an inter-plate boundary and frequently experience damaging earthquakes.</p><br>
        <p>The increase in earthquake risk is due to a spurt in developmental activities driven by urbanization, economic development and the globalization of India’s economy. The increase in use of high-technology equipment and tools in manufacturing and service industries has also made them susceptible to disruption due to relatively moderate ground shaking. As a result, loss of human life is not the only determinant of earthquake risk any more. Severe economic losses leading to the collapse of the local or regional economy after an earthquake may have long-term adverse consequences for the entire country. This effect would be further magnified if an earthquake affects a mega-city, such as Delhi or Mumbai.</p><br>

        <p>Earthquake prone zone</p>
        <p><b><u>What to do after an earthquake</u></b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Keep calm, switch on the radio/TV and obey any instructions you hear on it.</li>
            <li>Keep away from beaches and low banks of rivers. Huge waves may sweep in</li>
            <li>Turn off the water, gas and electricity.</li>
            <li>Do not smoke and do not light matches or use a cigarette lighter. Do not turn on switches. There may be gas leaks or short-circuits. Use a torch.</li>
            <li>If there is a fire, try to put it out. If you cannot, call the fire brigade</li>
            <li>If you know that people have been buried, tell the rescue teams. Do not rush and do not worsen the situation of injured persons or your own situation.</li>
            <li>Do not drink water from open containers without having examined it and filtered it through a sieve, a filter or an ordinary clean cloth.li>
            <li>If your home is badly damaged, you will have to leave it. Collect water containers, food, and ordinary and special medicines (for persons with heart complaints, diabetes, etc.)/li>
            <li>Do not re-enter badly damaged buildings and do not go near damaged structures.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b><u>Emergency kit</u></b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Battery operated torch</li>
            <li>Battery operated radio</li>
            <li>First aid kit and manual</li>
            <li>Emergency food (dry items) and water (packed and sealed)</li>
            <li>Candles and matches in a waterproof container</li>
            <li>Chlorine tablets or powdered water purifiers</li>
            <li>Can opener.</li>
            <li>Cash, Aadhar Card and Ration Card</li>
            <li>Thick ropes and cords</li>
            <li>Sturdy shoes</li>
